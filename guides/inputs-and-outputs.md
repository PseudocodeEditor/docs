### Inputs

To input values, the INPUT command is used, as follows:

```
INPUT <variable name>
```

An example of this would be:

```
INPUT num1
```

### Outputs

To output values, the OUTPUT command is used, as follows:

```
OUTPUT <value>
```

Multiple values can be output at the same time by using commas between each value.

```
OUTPUT <value1>, <value2>, <value3>
```

An example of a single output would be:

```
OUTPUT num1
```

Or multiple outputs:

```
OUTPUT num1, num2, num3
```
